# Understanding the server

The server is one of the 2 main interfaces to KageShirei, and by the mean, the most important for the remote control. {{ className: 'lead' }}

It is not by any mean _simple_, it is a composition of many functionalities and optimization merged together to achieve
the most from our and the public knowledge. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The server comes with one and only dependency, the PostgresSQL database driver. It can theoretically be installed on
both windows and *nix systems, but we recommend using a Linux distribution for the best performance and to enable all its
functionalities. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Move to the next section to learn more about the server's functionalities and how to interact with it. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Functionalities

The server is a complex system that is composed of many functionalities and optimizations merged together to achieve the
most from our and the public knowledge. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This means that the server is not just a simple piece of software that you can install and run, but a complex system,
highly configurable. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Configuration

The configuration of the server is done via a single file, the `config.json` file. {{ className: 'lead' }}
This can be located anywhere on the server machine but by default it is loaded from the current working directory. {{ className: 'lead' }}

A sample and always up-to-date configuration file can be found in the `server` folder of the repository named
`sample-config.json`. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The configuration file is composed of many sections, each one with its own purpose and functionalities. {{ className: 'lead' }}
