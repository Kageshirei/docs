## Error types

<Row>
    <Col>

        Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Protocol API will return an error response with an error type and
        message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the
        error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

        Here is a list of the two error types supported by the Protocol API â€” use these to understand what you have done
        wrong.

        <Properties>
            <Property name="api_error">
                This means that we made an error, which is highly speculative and unlikely.
            </Property>
            <Property name="invalid_request">
                This means that you made an error, which is much more likely.
            </Property>
        </Properties>

    </Col>
    <Col>

        ```bash {{title: "Error response"}}
        {
            "type": "api_error",
            "message": "No way this is happening!?",
            "documentation_url": "https://protocol.chat/docs/errors/api_error"
        }
        ```

    </Col>
</Row>
