# What is RS2?

RS2 is a modern, highly-customizable, command and control framework for red teams. {{ className: 'lead' }}
It has been designed to be powerful, and fully configurable, possibly loosing some points on simplicity due to the
many moving parts. {{ className: 'lead' }}

A common installation of this C2 is comprised by: {{ className: 'lead' }}
- One or more `agent`(s) that will be deployed on the target machine. {{ className: 'lead' }}
- A `server` responsible for the management of agents, connections, and tasks. {{ className: 'lead' }}
- A `command-and-control-gui` that will be used by red team operators to interact with the server. {{ className: 'lead' }}

All of these pieces may share some code via the usage of what we call `libs`, if you know Rust, you'll know them as
crates. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## How to get started

We've voluntarily chosen not to provide any precompiled binary, this decision was taken because of a series of factors: {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Creating precompiled binaries pollutes the release page with a large number of artifacts, as at least 3 artifacts
(probably 4 as soon as we set up also the `*nix-agent`) must be built for each architecture it will result in an
overall of more than 15 artifacts for each release, possibly with linked libraries. {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Security of everyone, as we do not take any responsibility for the improper use of this project we don't want to
inadvertently provide a powerful weapon to script kiddies, instead you must be able to set up your environment,
test it and configure it to correctly use RS2 (this is the reason why this documentation exits). {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Publishing precompiled agent binaries will result in: {{ className: 'lead' }}
  - Improper use of the agent due to precompiled urls or callback methods. {{ className: 'lead' }}
  - Av and EDR easily analise samples, maybe uncovering probably unwanted IOCs, probably resulting in all agents being
flagged as malicious. {{ className: 'lead' }}
  - The repository being flagged as malicious, none want this. {{ className: 'lead' }}
- The unfortunate possibility to find yourself playing with backdoor-ed artifacts
(if for some reason they get their way in the release page) resulting in a double compromise of your environment and
your victim. You should generally never trust precompiled binaries, as there have been many cases of backdoor-ed
artifacts, and try at most of your capability to compile from source whenever you can. {{ className: 'lead' }}

So how can you get started? It's easy, clone the repository, follow the installation instructions and compile your
own artifacts, starting from the `server` is the best idea as it has some, let's say _super-powers_. {{ className: 'lead' }}
